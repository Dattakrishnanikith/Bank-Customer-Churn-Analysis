💡 What is Churn Rate?

 Churn Rate = (Number of Customers Lost ÷ Total Customers) × 100

It measures how many customers leave a business over a specific period.

 By analyzing churn across different factors : age, geography, tenure, credit score, and activity level  we can uncover what drives customer departures.



The ultimate goal?

 👉 Identify root causes of churn

 👉 Design better retention strategies

 👉 Enhance customer experience

 👉 Reduce churn rates over time



📊 What the Report Covers:

 Definition: Churn Rate (or Customer Attrition / Jerk Rate)

 Purpose: Understand and minimize customer loss

 Approach: Analyze churn patterns across multiple customer factors

 Goal: Empower business users to act — launch retention campaigns, loyalty programs, or targeted interventions



🔍 Key Insights from the Power BI Dashboard:

🔹 Age & Credit Score Trends

 Churn peaks among customers aged 51–60 with credit scores below 400 — this combination consistently signals high churn risk.

🔹 Credit Card Ownership

 Customers with credit cards show a lower churn rate (~20.2%), suggesting that card ownership fosters stronger loyalty.

🔹 High-Balance Customers

 Customers without credit cards but holding balances above $200K are more likely to leave  possibly switching for better offers. A prime opportunity for retention strategies!

🔹 Product-Wise Churn

Product 1: ~27.7% churn, representing over half the customer base

Product 2: Up to 100% churn among low-balance customers ($1K–$10K)  a major red flag requiring deeper analysis

🔹 Activity Status Impact

 Inactive customers contribute to a 26.9% churn rate, highlighting inactivity as one of the strongest churn drivers.


🛠 Built With:

 Power BI  including data cleaning, data modeling, DAX measures, and conditional groupings.
